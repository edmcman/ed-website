Wow, it's been a while since I've seriously worked on my website.  It's been getting a little... well, dated.  A few weeks ago, I attended [CPOSC](https://www.cposc.org), and I saw a great talk on using [Gatsby](http://www.gatsbyjs.org) and other tools to statically generate websites.  It was a great talk, and it inspired me (and my wife) to overhaul our websites.

So, enter my new website.  It's not going to be terribly exciting, but it should be easier for me to update my blog when needed.  And it will give me an excuse to learn about the latest and greatest web technologies.  (As an aside, this is _way_ harder than it seems.  ReactJS, semantic UIs, and oh my.  Sometimes the hardest part is even knowing what to look at.)
